The amount paid by Google amounts to $2700, splitted as such:
  - $500 as stipends for mentoring a student
  - $1100 for Peter Korsgaard's travel expenses to the reunion
  - $1100 for Yann E. MORIN's travel expenses to the reunion

See commit c3f9199e325d (accounting/2016: add GSoC-2014 stippends)
This commit however had a typo in its commit log. It is said there
that Yann kept $100 to cover up for his travel expenses to the
reunion. It should be corrected and read as $1100.
